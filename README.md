# Mapping Library Integration

Welcome to our Proof of Concept (POC) project, where we aim to showcase the integration of different mapping libraries like Leaflet, OpenLayers, and MapBox.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of various mapping libraries into a Vue.js application. We provide information about each mapping library along with their key features.

## Libraries

### Leaflet

Leaflet is a lightweight open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps. It's designed with simplicity, performance, and usability in mind, making it ideal for web and mobile applications. With Leaflet, you can easily add markers, tooltips, custom icons, and much more to your maps.

### OpenLayers

OpenLayers is a powerful open-source JavaScript library for displaying and interacting with maps on web pages. It provides extensive support for various map projections, vector layers, raster layers, and overlays. OpenLayers offers rich features, including support for tooltips, markers, and custom icons, making it a versatile choice for mapping applications.

### MapBox

MapBox is a mapping platform that offers a range of tools and APIs for building custom maps and location-based applications. It provides powerful mapping solutions with support for styling, geocoding, routing, and much more. With MapBox, you can create stunning visualizations and integrate advanced features like tooltips, markers, and custom icons into your maps effortlessly.

## Key Features

- Current Location
- Marker (Single / Multiple)
- Tooltip Support
- Custom Icons
- Polygons for area marking
